# People Killed by Police in the United States
##Data Products Project

Inspired by The Guardian's [The Counted project](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database).

See my [slidify deck](http://joshmorel.github.io/killed_by_police/code/finalcode/slidify/killed_by_police/index.html) for an introduction to this project.

Check out my [interactive shiny app](https://josh-morel.shinyapps.io/killed_by_police/) for data exploration and a demonstration of the integration of `shiny`, `ggvis` & `leaflet`.
